The mission successfully landed on the Moon on November 19, 1969, with a precision landing within walking distance of the Surveyor 3 spacecraft, which had been on the Moon since 1967. Astronauts Charles "Pete" Conrad and Alan L. Bean were trained in geology to conduct detailed surveys of the lunar surface. They visited Surveyor 3, partially disassembling it to analyze how the spacecraft's materials had weathered lunar solar radiation over the years. Apollo 12 also deployed the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Packages (ALSEP), including scientific instruments such as the Passive Lunar Seismic Experiment, Lunar Surface Magnetometer, and Active Seismic Experiment, among others. The astronauts performed two EVAs (extravehicular activities) totaling 7 hours and 45 minutes, collecting 34.35 kilograms of lunar samples. The mission's success confirmed NASA’s ability to execute precision landings on the Moon, which was vital for future scientific missions. The data gathered, including information about lunar wear on spacecraft materials, significantly advanced lunar exploration and instrumentation design for subsequent missions.

Its primary objectives were to land at the site originally intended for Apollo 13 (the Fra Mauro region), collect lunar surface samples, and deploy scientific experiments. The mission faced numerous challenges, including a malfunction in the spacecraft during flight, but it successfully landed and completed its objectives. Astronauts Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell conducted two extravehicular activities (EVAs) totaling 9 hours and 22 minutes. They deployed the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Packages (ALSEP) and conducted geological surveys of the crater, gathering data about the Moon's history and surface composition. They collected 42.8 kilograms of lunar samples, which contributed to further understanding of the Moon’s geological makeup. This mission marked the last of the Apollo landings focused on specific scientific sites for relatively short EVAs. Despite the difficulties experienced in-flight, Apollo 14 succeeded in continuing the Apollo program and reaffirming NASA’s capabilities. The landing site at Fra Mauro (coordinates -3.6453, -17.47136) was particularly significant, as it was the one intended for Apollo 13 before that mission was aborted.

The mission included three extravehicular activities (EVAs), totaling 20 hours and 14 minutes, during which 95.71 kilograms of samples were collected. Apollo 16 returned the largest lunar rock of any Apollo mission and provided valuable data on micrometeorite impacts on the lunar surface, though no conclusive effects from cosmic rays on organics were found. The mission also deployed the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) and provided live feed back to Earth, further enhancing our understanding of the Moon’s surface. The landing site, located in the Descartes Highlands (8.97301° S, 15.50019° E), was chosen for its unique geological features. Despite technical malfunctions during the mission, the crew was able to work around them, proving NASA's ability to handle challenges in space exploration.

The mission focused heavily on scientific experiments, including a biological experiment with mice, which aimed to study the effects of cosmic rays on organics, though no clear answers were found. The crew sampled lunar highland material, older than the Mare Imbrium, and investigated relatively recent volcanic activity on the Moon. Apollo 17 featured more extensive geological surveys, with all astronauts having prior lunar mission experience, and included the use of the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) for further exploration. The mission also deployed the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) to gather additional data. Apollo 17 set records for the longest stay on the Moon, the longest extravehicular activities (EVAs), and the most orbits around the Moon. Over the course of three EVAs (totaling 22 hours and 3 minutes), the astronauts collected 115 kilograms of lunar samples from the Taurus–Littrow valley. This mission concluded the Apollo program, wrapping up nearly a decade of lunar exploration and marking the end of the Apollo era. The focus of NASA subsequently shifted to Earth orbit stations, with declining budgets and public support signaling the end of manned lunar missions for the time being.
